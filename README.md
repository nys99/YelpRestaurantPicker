# YelpRestaurantPicker

YelpRestaurantPicker is an iOS application that aims to help people select a place to eat. Groups of friends (at least my friends) can be indecisive when it comes to picking a place to eat. YelpRestaurantPicker uses the Yelp API to find a list of restuarants in the area in a give price range and displays them to the user in a manner that helps them narrow it down to a single place to eat.
